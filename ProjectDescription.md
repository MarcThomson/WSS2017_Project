Prediction of Chemical Properties Using Deep Learning
I am planning to construct a neural network using curated chemical data to predict a chemical's properties from its structure. For simplicity, I am beginning with organics compounds containing only C,H,O, or N. I am still uncertain of the optimal way to describe the chemical structure in a way the neural network can understand. I am considering using the atomic positions, adjacency matrix, SMILES string, and images of chemical structure to predict properties.
